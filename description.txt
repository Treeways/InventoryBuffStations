Annoyed with placing the cake for the mining buff?
Tired of forgetting to use buff stations?

Look no further - simply right-click one of these stations from your inventory for the buff!

Works with:
- Slice of Cake
- Ammo Box
- Bewitchment Table
- Crystal Ball
- Sharpening Station
- War Table

Also compatible with Fargo's Mutant Mod (ie. the "Automatic Station Buffs When Nearby" option).

Optional QoL features (toggleable options, disabled by default):
- Infinite Slice of Cake buff duration
- Automatic station buffs, as long as they're in the player's inventory or storage (Piggy Bank, Safe, Void Vault or Defender's Forge)

Feel free to leave a feature suggestion, or a mod compatibility addon.
